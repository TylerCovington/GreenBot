The iFrame in the page above uses: https://github.com/MishUshakov/dialogflow-web<br>
Note: Avoid "npm init", use "npm install" instead.<br>
We are waiting for DialogFlow 2.0 version from MishUshakov

<b>Projects:</b>

1. Display available bikeshare locations from [Coord.co](https://Coord.co) API. - DONE<br>
Notes: A few cities require [General Bikeshare Feed Specification (GBFS)](https://github.com/NABSA/gbfs) feeds, but it is not consistent nor consistently enforced. Coord.co API also provides Atlanta Ride-hail data.

2. Convert 2012-2016 Detailed Table > Block Groups (sets of census blocks) from Tiger.<br>
https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-data.html<br>
(Blocks are only available every 10 years.)

3. Pull greenspace from OpenStreetMaps, use shapes instead of boundaries. - James<br>
https://forum.openstreetmap.org/viewtopic.php?id=61119<br>
Resulting Atlanta park outline dataset in Carto:<br>

4. Combine city, state and national park data in Google Firestore.<br>
https://medium.com/vue-mastery/full-stack-vue-js-with-firestore-62e2fe2ec1f3

5. Show amount of greenspace relative to each census block group. (Needs to add up greenspace from GROUP  BY clause, and also include sum of greenspace area with 1/4 mile of block group.)<br>

```SQL
SELECT geoid areaID, the_geom, sum(ST_Area(the_geom)/100) AS area, sum(ST_Area(green_geom)/100) AS green_area
FROM (
  SELECT a.geoid, a.the_geom, b.the_geom green_geom
  FROM cb_2016_13_bg_500k a
  JOIN atlanta_greenspace b ON ST_Intersects(a.the_geom, b.the_geom)
) sub
GROUP BY areaID, the_geom
ORDER BY areaID
```
[Percentage of Polygon Sample](https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/65956/percentage-of-polygon-in-one-shapefile-within-polygon-of-another)

6. Add sample maps using Google, Carto and MapBox<br>
Parks and green space layers in a combined Carto map.<br>

7. Find Firebase Function samples using DialogFlow v2 with Firestore.<br>

## Firebase Function Install Steps

Our DialogFlow project loads the Firebase Function in this GreenBot repo.

cd firebase/functions

npm install

firebase login

firebase init

These can differ:<br>
What language would you like to use to write Cloud Functions? JavaScript<br>
Do you want to use ESLint to catch probable bugs and enforce style? No<br>
File functions/package.json already exists. Overwrite? No<br>
&nbsp; Skipping write of functions/package.json<br>
File functions/index.js already exists. Overwrite? No<br>
&nbsp; Skipping write of functions/index.js<br>
Do you want to install dependencies with npm now? No<br>
Allow Firebase to collect anonymous info - n

Deploy your Cloud Function for Firebase with:<br>
 firebase deploy --only functions:dialogflowFirebaseFulfillment
